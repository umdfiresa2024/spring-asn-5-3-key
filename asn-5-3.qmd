In this assignment you will use the functions that you have learned to replicate the Pollution emissions and Air quality section of Table 1 in *Defensive Investments and the Demand for Air Quality: Evidence from the NOx Budget Program* by DeschÃªnes et al. (2017).

#### Step 1 (1 point)

Declare that you will use the **tidyverse** package.

```{r}

```

#### Step 2 (2 points)

Upload pollution emissions data from the year 2001 to 2007 into the environment and combine them together into one dataframe called **df.**

```{r}

```

#### Question 1: What is the unit of NOx, SO2, and CO2 pollution emissions in Table 1? Fill in the blank. **(3 points)**

#### Answer: \_\_\_\_\_ tons per \_\_\_\_\_ (state/city/county) during the \_\_\_\_ months of each year.

#### Step 3 (4 points)

Create a new dataframe named **df2** which has the total **summertime** NOx, SO2, and CO2 emissions (in **thousand tons**) for each **County**, **State**, and **Year**. Note that the summer months include May through September.

```{r}

```

#### Step 4 (1 point)

Upload the **counties_t2a.csv** file into the environment. Name the dataframe **counties**. This dataframe is the list of all counties that satisfies the selection criteria in the paper *Defensive Investments and the Demand for Air Quality: Evidence from the NOx Budget Program* as described below.

```{r}

```

#### Step 5

To make an accurate summary statistics table, we need to make a balanced panel with all the counties and year that we are interested in. The table will summarize data from all counties and all years.

This can be done by first creating a vector of all the years we are interested in. Afterward, we will use the **crossing** function to create a combination of all the counties and year we are interested in. Since we have 7 years and 2253 counties, the balanced panel will have 7 x 2,253 = 15,771 observations.

The code is shown below. You just have to run it.

```{r}
Year<-seq(2001,2007,by=1)

cy<-crossing(counties, Year)
```

Next, we will add the emissions data from **df2** into **cy**.

#### Question 2: What three variables do df2 and cy have in common? (3 points)

#### Answer: 

#### Step 6 (4 points)

Add the emissions data from **df2** into **cy** by using the **merge** function by matching observations that has the same **State**, **County**, and **Year**.

Name the merged dataframe **emit.**

Make sure that the dataframe **emit** has all the observations in **cy**, but not the observations in **df2** that does not match with **cy**.

Hint: You learned how to do this in [this DataCamp video.](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-with-datatable-in-r/joining-multiple-datatables?ex=8)

```{r}

```

#### Step 7 (2 points)

Create a new dataframe named **emit_mean** from **emit.**

Replace all the NA values that the columns that represent NOx, SO2, and CO2 emissions with 0.

Afterward, use the **summarize** and **mean** function to find the average NOx, SO2, and CO2 emissions across all counties and years. Name the variables **mean_NOx**, **mean_SO2**, and **mean_CO2**.

```{r}

```

#### Step 8 (2 points)

Create a new dataframe named **emit_sd** from **emit.**

Replace all the NA values that the columns that represent NOx, SO2, and CO2 emissions with 0.

Afterward, use the **summarize** and **sd** function to find the standard deviation of NOx, SO2, and CO2 emissions across all counties and years. Name the variables **sd_NOx**, **sd_SO2**, and **sd_CO2**.

```{r}

```

#### Step 9

We will use the **pivot_longer** function to format our results in table format of the original paper. The code is shown below. You just have to run it.

```{r}
mean_long<-pivot_longer(emit_mean,
                        cols=1:3,
                        names_to = "Pollution emissions (000's of tons/summer)",
                        names_prefix="mean_", 
                        values_to = "Mean") 

sd_long<-pivot_longer(emit_sd,
                        cols=1:3,
                        names_to = "Pollution emissions (000's of tons/summer)",
                        names_prefix="sd_", 
                        values_to = "SD") 

T1a<-merge(mean_long, sd_long, 
           by="Pollution emissions (000's of tons/summer)") %>%
  mutate(n=nrow(counties)) 

print(T1a)
```

#### Question 3: Compare the mean of NOx, standard deviation of NOx, and counties with data to the numbers presented in the original paper. Which ones are greater? (3 points)

#### Answer: 

#### Step 10: Click Render to generate an html file of this document. **(1 point)**
